	I WEll BE WELL-BEHAVED, JUST LET IT OBEDIENT

	1. Definitions.
		Kuai Kuai culture (or Guai Guai culture) is a phenomenon in Taiwan wherein 
		workers put snacks of the brand Kuai Kuai (乖乖) next to or on top of machines. 
		Workers who do this believe that, because the name of the snack - "Kuai Kuai" 
		- stands for "obedient" or "well-behaved," it will make a device function 
		without errors. As such, it can be commonly found in myriad places of work in 
		Taiwanese society. A rigid set of best practices has arisen surrounding the 
		proper use of Kuai Kuai snacks, such as using green bags only, and ensuring 
		the snacks are not expired.

	2. Cultural influence.
		Kuai Kuai Company Limited [zh] was established in 1968. The company produces 
		mainly cookies and puff corn snacks; among these is a line of puff corn snacks 
		bearing the company's name. Kuai Kuai is a puff corn product.

		The practice of adorning machines with the snack was documented as early as 
		2008. Adornment is not only an informal convention of the information industry 
		in Taiwan, but also expands to other fields of industries. Kuai Kuai is 
		now placed next to the devices of server rooms, ATMs, ticket booths, control 
		systems, and toll booths. It was also seen in places such as a computer center
		, a social affairs bureau, an architecture of sustainability, a police station
		, a hospital, an office of nursing, a center of domestic violence and sexual 
		assault prevention, a cutting room, a theater, household registration offices,
		and examination halls for national tests. It is also among the only items of 
		food that one can bring into otherwise-fragile computer and server rooms.

		The culture is seen by some people as superstition, but some others believe it 
		whole-heartedly. For example, movie director Chi Po-lin is on the record as 
		saying, "I write my name (on the bag) and I am not fooling around." However, 
		the vice professor of Taipei City University of Science and Technology, 
		Jiang Tsan-Teng, points out that the purported stabilizing effects of
		Kuai Kuai may be purely a coincidence, and the snack is only a placebo for 
		engineers.
	
	3. Convention.
		The placement of Kuai Kuai is rather rigid. Because the indication light 
		denoting correct function is green, the snack bag should be only the 
		corresponding green one (coconut flavor). Conversely, the yellow or red ones 
		represent abnormality and thus should not be used. For instance, in May 2017 
		during the collection of consolidated income taxes, the Ministry of Finance in 
		Taiwan tried to place Kuai Kuai to save the overwhelmed operational systems 
		due to overload access. However, they bought the yellow-colored bags, drawing 
		criticism from netizens in Taiwan. The Kuomintang congressperson Lu Shiow-Yen
		mentioned to the Ministry of Finance, when reviewing drafts of acts, that the 
		Ministry must keep up with the conventions and not make mistakes with the 
		color of the bag. However, the snack company itself proposes a different set 
		of conventions. Green bags are for electronic devices and computer rooms. 
		Yellow bags stand for gold and fortunes, so it is more welcome in the 
		financial and banking industries. The red bags stands for love, so the company
		sells limited amounts for Valentine's Day or Mother's Day.

		According to the prevailing culture, one must be aware of not only the color 
		difference but also the expiration date. It is important to not place expired 
		Kuai Kuai; expired products must be replaced immediately. Workers must also 
		check the bags for signs of damage, lest the food inside be consumed by 
		cockroaches or mice. Importantly, no one is permitted to open and eat snacks 
		adorning machines themselves or haphazardly replace them. News reports in 
		Taiwan have placed the blame for some accidents on improper Kuai Kuai usage.
	
	4. Partnerships.
		The placement Kuai Kuai is often closely tied to machinery and equipment, so 
		it is often considered part of the essential supply chain in the information 
		industry in Taiwan. In 2016, the earthquake in Kaohsiung damaged the 
		production line of TSMC in Southern Taiwan Science Park, and the TSMC engineers 
		ordered a special edition of Kuai Kuai after they repaired the production line 
		for the company staff. On the bag is customized print bearing the words "FAB14A 
		222K limited edition" (FAB14A 222K) and the mascot of the factory Black-faced 
		spoonbill; the limited edition bag could be found being sold on the internet 
		for twenty times the ordinary price. After the event, other information companies 
		also commissioned the Kuai Kuai company for custom editions. For example, 
		Microsoft in Taiwan has collaborated with Kuai Kuai for the special edition of 
		the "Peacock rice puff" (孔雀香酥脆);[34] in March 2017, when the Taoyuan Airport 
		MRT was opened, the MRT made 60,000 green bags that read, "Just take the MRT, 
		it saves time" (乖乖搭捷運，省時又快捷) for the general public; Chung-Hua Bank 
		also collaborated with Kuai Kuai to produce golden bags of five spiced flavor.

		In June 2017, when the German theme park Europa-Park announced the opening of a 
		flying theater called "Voletarium," Kuai Kuai snacks were placed in the center 
		of the press conference stage. The park introduced the snack to the public, 
		calling it "an extraordinary tradition from Taiwan". Brogent, the company in 
		charge of Voletarium, requires that gaming equipment outside of Taiwan from its 
		company are all adorned with Kuai Kuai; the precise manner in which this is to 
		be done is written in the relevant contracts.

		Before the launch of Formosat-5, the first indigenous Taiwanese optical remote 
		surveillance satellite, staff in the National Applied Research Laboratories 
		piled up Kuai Kuai around the satellite model, to pray that all went well in the 
		launching process. For the occasion, the Kuai Kuai company printed out another 
		special edition bag with the laboratories reading, "All the amazing views from 
		space will be taken into our lens" (太空浩瀚無垠，乖乖盡收眼底).
